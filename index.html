            <article class="feature"><p>Even the highest quality waterproof shoes and boots eventually lose their original waterproof finish. You’ll know when water no longer bead’s up on your boot’s surface. Fortunately, the process to bring your hiking boots back to water-resistant life is quite simple. Besides the obvious advantages of keeping your feet dry in wet weather and on puddle-prone trails, waterproofing your hiking boots can greatly extend their life. This is particularly true when your boots are regularly exposed to wet conditions. Read on for step-by-step instructions for waterproofing your hiking boots.</p></article>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fabriano-L’Aquila, 257 km.</strong></a>
                        <p>Called Italy’s first “solidarity” trail, this “walk in changed lands” introduces people and projects devoted to rebuilding after the 2016 earthquake. Following the faultline, it links two national parks, Monti Sibillini and Gran Sasso, highlighting the wonders of nature but also the aftermath of the natural disaster, and tries to help communities create sustainable tourism jobs.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Norcia–Montecassino, 304km.</strong></a>
                        <p>This trail from Umbria’s Sibillini mountains, via the Abbey of Subiaco to Montecassino, follows the life of Saint Benedict, born around AD480 in Norcia, where the abbey that bears his name is still being rebuilt after the 2016 earthquake. The trail takes in other Benedictine monasteries, plus hill villages, thick woods and Apennine meadows.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Saint Bernard Pass–Rome, 1,006km.</strong></a>
                        <p>This medieval route actually runs from Canterbury to Rome – and eventually Jerusalem. The main Italian trail starts in the western Alps then crosses the Po valley and heads through Tuscany and into Lazio, where pilgrims can heal tired limbs in ancient hot springs.</p></li>
